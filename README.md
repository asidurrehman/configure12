This repository contains Python code for the Cost-benefit Optimisation Framework for Implementing blue-Green infrastructURE (CONFIGURE) version 1.2. This version is designed specifically to optimise the location and size of detention ponds for multiple rainfall return periods by calculating Expected Annual Damage (EAD). Currently, the associated article titled **Integrated evolutionary optimisation framework for explicit configuration of detention ponds in urban flood risk management** is under the process of peer review. A detailed README update to follow soon.
